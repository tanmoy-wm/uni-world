                        <p>The Queen, black cabs, and tea are just a few things that the United Kingdom are famous for. The UK is also a popular destination for international students entering higher education, and boasts many well-known universities and colleges that rank high throughout the world. In this article we’ll explore the process of applying to study in the United Kingdom as an international student, and answer some of your frequently asked questions.</p>
                        <p>Please note: Always review the program requirements before submitting an application to be sure it is complete and that the applicant meets the minimum eligibility criteria. Competitive programs may have a different set of eligibility criteria. Incomplete applications face the risk of rejection due to missing and/or incomplete documents and not meeting all of the admission requirements.</p>
                        <h2>Step 1: Review the Application Requirements</h2>
                        <h4>Admission Into a Higher Education Course</h4>
                        <p>Universities and colleges set their own entry requirements for higher education courses, and these vary widely depending on the subject, the specific course, and the course provider.</p>
                        <h4>Academic Qualifications</h4>
                        <p>Education providers require students to have successfully attained prior levels of qualifications to ensure they will have the right skills and knowledge to complete their chosen higher education course. Students need to provide transcripts to show they meet the academic requirements for admission.</p>
                        <p>For admission into undergraduate level university courses, prior completion of A-levels, Advanced Highers or equivalent-level qualifications is required. The marks that are considered acceptable varies by course and by institution.</p>
                        <p>Higher marks are usually needed to gain admission into more competitive or in-demand courses. Most courses will also expect students to have some pre-16 qualifications, such as GCSE English and maths, or their equivalents.</p>
                        <p>Students will also need to have taken subjects related to their chosen higher education course, known as prerequisite courses. For example, a student seeking admission into an Engineering program will need to have completed Grade 12-equivalent math courses.</p>
                        <h2>Step 2: Review the English Language Requirements</h2>
                        <p>Since English is the primary language of instruction in the UK, students applying from a non-English speaking country need to demonstrate English proficiency through an English language test as part of the admission process. Standardized English language tests evaluate students on their reading, listening, speaking and writing skills.</p>
                        <p>The following tests are commonly accepted for entry into degree-level courses:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>International English Language Testing System (IELTS)</li>
                          <li>Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) - Internet-Based Test (IBT)</li>
                          <li>Pearson Test of English (PTE)</li>
                          <li>Cambridge Advanced Certificate in English (CAE)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Language test scores required for admission vary by institution and by program. Some institutions only look at the overall scores, while others have cut-offs for scores in each of the four skills sections. Typically, students applying to an undergraduate course need:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>IELTS scores between 5.5 and 6.5 (usually 6.0), with no band less than 5.5 or 6.0, or</li>
                          <li>TOEFL (internet-based test, iBT) scores between 60.0 and 90.0 overall, or</li>
                          <li>PTE Academic score between 50 to 64 overall, or</li>
                          <li>CAE or CPE score between 169 to 176 overall, with no less than 169 in each category.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Step 3: Gather Supplementary Requirements</h2>
                        <p>Depending on the nature of the program, students may need to provide supplementary non-academic documents or test scores to support their admission application. These could include:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Personal statement</li>
                          <li>Resume/CV</li>
                          <li>Interviews</li>
                          <li>References</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Step 4: Review Application Deadlines</h2>
                        <p>An academic year typically begins in September in the UK, and includes three terms:</p>
                        <p><strong>Autumn/Fall: September to December<br />
                          Spring: January to April<br />
                          Summer: May to August
                        </strong></p>
                        <p>Since the calendar year begins in Autumn, most institutions offer admission for entry in September, but selected programs also accept students for Spring and Summer intakes. Additionally, some institutions also offer courses at multiple times during the year, and therefore have varying deadlines for each start date.</p>
                        <p>In general, undergraduate admission deadlines for the September intake are:</p>
                        <p>Mid-October: For courses at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, or for most courses in medicine, veterinary medicine/science, and dentistry. Mid-January: for the majority of courses End of June: Recommended final deadline for international students to ensure they’ll have enough time to apply for and obtain a visa after receiving their confirmation of acceptance (CAS).</p>
                        <p>Graduate degree courses often have a lengthier application process and more flexible applications deadlines. Graduate diploma and certificate programs follow similar deadlines as those outlined above.</p>
                        <h2>Step 5: Apply Online!</h2>
                        <p>Once the student has ensured that they meet the criteria for admission and have gathered all required documentation it’s time to submit the application through ApplyBoard’s online portal!</p>

                        <p>The Queen, black cabs, and tea are just a few things that the United Kingdom are famous for. The UK is also a popular destination for international students entering higher education, and boasts many well-known universities and colleges that rank high throughout the world. In this article we’ll explore the process of applying to study in the United Kingdom as an international student, and answer some of your frequently asked questions.</p>
                        <p>Please note: Always review the program requirements before submitting an application to be sure it is complete and that the applicant meets the minimum eligibility criteria. Competitive programs may have a different set of eligibility criteria. Incomplete applications face the risk of rejection due to missing and/or incomplete documents and not meeting all of the admission requirements.</p>
                        <h2>Step 1: Review the Application Requirements</h2>
                        <h4>Admission Into a Higher Education Course</h4>
                        <p>Universities and colleges set their own entry requirements for higher education courses, and these vary widely depending on the subject, the specific course, and the course provider.</p>
                        <h4>Academic Qualifications</h4>
                        <p>Education providers require students to have successfully attained prior levels of qualifications to ensure they will have the right skills and knowledge to complete their chosen higher education course. Students need to provide transcripts to show they meet the academic requirements for admission.</p>
                        <p>For admission into undergraduate level university courses, prior completion of A-levels, Advanced Highers or equivalent-level qualifications is required. The marks that are considered acceptable varies by course and by institution.</p>
                        <p>Higher marks are usually needed to gain admission into more competitive or in-demand courses. Most courses will also expect students to have some pre-16 qualifications, such as GCSE English and maths, or their equivalents.</p>
                        <p>Students will also need to have taken subjects related to their chosen higher education course, known as prerequisite courses. For example, a student seeking admission into an Engineering program will need to have completed Grade 12-equivalent math courses.</p>
                        <h2>Step 2: Review the English Language Requirements</h2>
                        <p>Since English is the primary language of instruction in the UK, students applying from a non-English speaking country need to demonstrate English proficiency through an English language test as part of the admission process. Standardized English language tests evaluate students on their reading, listening, speaking and writing skills.</p>
                        <p>The following tests are commonly accepted for entry into degree-level courses:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>International English Language Testing System (IELTS)</li>
                          <li>Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) - Internet-Based Test (IBT)</li>
                          <li>Pearson Test of English (PTE)</li>
                          <li>Cambridge Advanced Certificate in English (CAE)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Language test scores required for admission vary by institution and by program. Some institutions only look at the overall scores, while others have cut-offs for scores in each of the four skills sections. Typically, students applying to an undergraduate course need:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>IELTS scores between 5.5 and 6.5 (usually 6.0), with no band less than 5.5 or 6.0, or</li>
                          <li>TOEFL (internet-based test, iBT) scores between 60.0 and 90.0 overall, or</li>
                          <li>PTE Academic score between 50 to 64 overall, or</li>
                          <li>CAE or CPE score between 169 to 176 overall, with no less than 169 in each category.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Step 3: Gather Supplementary Requirements</h2>
                        <p>Depending on the nature of the program, students may need to provide supplementary non-academic documents or test scores to support their admission application. These could include:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Personal statement</li>
                          <li>Resume/CV</li>
                          <li>Interviews</li>
                          <li>References</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Step 4: Review Application Deadlines</h2>
                        <p>An academic year typically begins in September in the UK, and includes three terms:</p>
                        <p><strong>Autumn/Fall: September to December<br />
                          Spring: January to April<br />
                          Summer: May to August

                        </ul>
                        <p>Language test scores required for admission vary by institution and by program. Some institutions only look at the overall scores, while others have cut-offs for scores in each of the four skills sections. Typically, students applying to an undergraduate course need:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>IELTS scores between 5.5 and 6.5 (usually 6.0), with no band less than 5.5 or 6.0, or</li>
                          <li>TOEFL (internet-based test, iBT) scores between 60.0 and 90.0 overall, or</li>
                          <li>PTE Academic score between 50 to 64 overall, or</li>
                          <li>CAE or CPE score between 169 to 176 overall, with no less than 169 in each category.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Step 3: Gather Supplementary Requirements</h2>
                        <p>Depending on the nature of the program, students may need to provide supplementary non-academic documents or test scores to support their admission application. These could include:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Personal statement</li>
                          <li>Resume/CV</li>
                          <li>Interviews</li>
                          <li>References</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Step 4: Review Application Deadlines</h2>
                        <p>An academic year typically begins in September in the UK, and includes three terms:</p>
                        <p><strong>Autumn/Fall: September to December<br />
                          Spring: January to April<br />
                          Summer: May to August
                        </strong></p>
                        <p>Since the calendar year begins in Autumn, most institutions offer admission for entry in September, but selected programs also accept students for Spring and Summer intakes. Additionally, some institutions also offer courses at multiple times during the year, and therefore have varying deadlines for each start date.</p>
                        <p>In general, undergraduate admission deadlines for the September intake are:</p>
                        <p>Mid-October: For courses at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, or for most courses in medicine, veterinary medicine/science, and dentistry. Mid-January: for the majority of courses End of June: Recommended final deadline for international students to ensure they’ll have enough time to apply for and obtain a visa after receiving their confirmation of acceptance (CAS).</p>
                        <p>Graduate degree courses often have a lengthier application process and more flexible applications deadlines. Graduate diploma and certificate programs follow similar deadlines as those outlined above.</p>
                        <h2>Step 5: Apply Online!</h2>
                        <p>Once the student has ensured that they meet the criteria for admission and have gathered all required documentation it’s time to submit the application through ApplyBoard’s online portal!</p>
