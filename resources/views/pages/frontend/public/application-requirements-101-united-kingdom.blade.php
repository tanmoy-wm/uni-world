                                                        education courses, and these vary widely depending on the subject,
                                                        the specific course, and the course provider.</p>
                                                    <h4>Academic Qualifications</h4>
                                                    <p>Education providers require students to have successfully attained
                                                        prior levels of qualifications to ensure they will have the right

                                                        course. Students need to provide transcripts to show they meet the

                                                        varies by course and by institution.</p>
                                                    <p>Higher marks are usually needed to gain admission into more
                                                        competitive or in-demand courses. Most courses will also expect

                                                    <p>Students will also need to have taken subjects related to their

                                                        part of the admission process. Standardized English language tests
                                                        evaluate students on their reading, listening, speaking and writing

                                                        students for Spring and Summer intakes. Additionally, some
